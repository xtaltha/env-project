<sup>REDmodding mod repository.</sup>

<sub>_put a brief description here&mdash;if you have a nexus brief description you can just copy it here_</sub>  
defacto does absolutely nothing.

<sub>_keep this intact, it's a good way to notify a user as to what they can and can't do with your mod._</sub>

## Overview

<sub>_here you should change everything, including the name xtaltha, etc., to fit a descriptive overview of the your mod. **Don't let this placeholder text influence you.**_</sub>

defacto is a mod that does absolutely nothing and serves only to be an example for mod authors to base their own descriptions and mods off of. It is part of the **[cpmodproj]** project, which in turn is made by **[xtaltha]**, a REDmodding organization.

Created to serve the modding community and allow open-source REDmodding to expand, defacto has been made to show off what can be done using **[cpmodproj]**&mdash;which is a template repository to make it easier to create mods that are on GitHub.

### External links

<sup>_attach external links like tumblr or nexusmods here._</sup>

## Installation

<sub>_most of this should go unchanged considering most will be using the built-in Actions workflow provided by **[cpmodproj]**, but, make sure to change this if you do something different._</sub>

You can find the most up-to-date, possibly unstable, versions under the _Actions_ header at the top of the GitHub UI and download the _mod_ artifact.
To get release versions, you can also find them under _Releases_ on the right of the GitHub UI.

<sub>_you can delete the latter part about providing a REDmod style if you don't want to support it._</sub>  
The _mod_ artifacts are packed with a traditional packing style (e.g. `/archive/pc/mod/`), while Releases should provide a REDmod **and** Traditional version.

## Building

<sub>_you can edit this if you have special steps users need to follow to build this mod._</sub>

To build defacto, you just need to open the defacto.cpmodproj file in **[WolvenKit]** and install it as a REDmod or as a traditional mod. **[WolvenKit]** should take care of the rest.

<sub>_if you really don't want users to report issues on GitHub, you can get rid of this part and turn off the Issues tab._</sub>  
If it doesn't, please open an issue in the _Issues_ tab&mdash;as well as if you can detect any invalid stuff in the source.
